* JanimateS
* Background and Overview:

    * JanimateS is a similar game to the asteroids javascript game where the player is represented by a ship/circle in the canvas. There will be other astoroids coming from all directions into close proximity to the user's ship. The way the user can defend or play is by choosing a direction with the arrow keys and by cliking on the incoming asteroids to make them dissapear. 

    * Motivation for the game was the visualization and physics challenge behind the game. I like the idea of the game and the simplicity presented to the user. 

* Functionality and MVP Features
    * 1 - Create inital canvas as background/container for game and user's ship along with asteroids. 

    * 2 - Allow the user to choose a direction with arrow keys and make canvas as container, meaning that ship will bounce off edges of the canvas. 
    * 3 - 
    * Be especially detailed
* Architecture and Technologies
    * Vanilla JavaScript for game logic.
    * HTML5 Canvas for rendering.
    * Howler.js (or HTML audio player) for game   background music.
    * Webpack to bundle various scripts into a single source.
